When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [[/r 2d6]] fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">At Higher Levels.</span></span> <p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"XGE","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"10","units":"minute"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":0,"width":null,"units":"self","type":"self"},"range":{"value":0,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"cha","actionType":"save","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["2d6","fire"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"dex","dc":null,"scaling":"cha"},"level":3,"school":"evo","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"img":"icons/magic/earth/projectiles-stone-salvo-red.webp","ownership":{"default":0,"HqljdJXtGbbW72SW":3},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"spells.html","source":"XGE","hash":"melf's%20minute%20meteors_xge","propDroppable":"spell"}},"effects":[],"_id":"yPKjrPbBGwbq6AQ3","folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682649102348,"modifiedTime":1682649102348,"lastModifiedBy":"HqljdJXtGbbW72SW"}},{"name":"Stoneskin","type":"spell","system":{"description":{"value":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone.
